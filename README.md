# ECMA-31350-Final-Project

All the raw data sets are contained in the folder Datasets(Raw).
All the cleaned data sets are stored in the folder Datasets(Cleaned).
You can safely ignore the other folders.

The main code for the project is in the file ECMA_31320_code.ipynb. Opening this in Jupyter notebook will allow you to run all the cells 
simultaneously by clicking on the >> button at the top.
This code cleans all the data from Datasets(Raw) in the first half and stores it in Datasets(Cleaned). Then, in the second half, the 
cleaned data is retrieved and used for all the regressions. There are comments in the code to highlight what each code block does. There 
are also sections of code so you can easily navigate to the relevant parts of the code you want to inspect.
